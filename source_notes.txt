seqUtil.cpp, Newickform.cpp   modified version of the tree parser of Yu-Wei Wu (Indiana Univ), http://yuweibioinfo.blogspot.com/2008/10/newick-tree-parser-in-c-make-use-of.html

expm.hpp Function calculating matrix exponential was adopted from: https://www.dbtsai.com/blog/2008-11-25-matrix-exponential/
